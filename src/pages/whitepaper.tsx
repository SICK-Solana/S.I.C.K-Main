        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Use Case Examples</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Influencer Krates:</strong> "HariKrat," a popular Web3 influencer, creates a high-risk, 
            high-reward Krate featuring Solana, Bonk, and other emerging tokens. Their followers can instantly 
            invest in this Krate with a single click.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Thematic Investing:</strong> A user creates a "DeFi Innovators" Krate, bundling tokens of 
            promising decentralized finance projects. They share it on X, attracting attention from DeFi enthusiasts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Contrarian Plays:</strong> Some users might create "Short Krates" for influencers they perceive 
            as unlucky or "panauti." For example, a "Reverse MBAChaiwala" Krate that bets against the influencer's picks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Content-Driven Discovery:</strong> While scrolling through Web3 reels about NFT projects, 
            a user discovers a curated "NFT Ecosystem" Krate featuring tokens of platforms and projects mentioned in the content.
          </li>
        </ul>
